Cryptography Abstraction Layer for PHP
======================================

Cryptal provides a unified API to help developers create applications
that use cryptographic primitives and work in various environments.
That way, developers can focus on writing the logic for their application
rather than having to deal with subtleties in cryptographic implementations.
